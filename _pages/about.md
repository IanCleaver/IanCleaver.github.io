#My Background

I was born and raised in Guatemala. Where I was raised by the strongest and most amaizing woman, my mother.
I moved to the US for college when I was 16. For my freshman year I spent it as a student at Florida Intitute of Technology.
Then I transferred to Florida State University where I am looking to finish my major in Computer Science.

#Whats going on with me now?

Recently finished my first sophomore semester. During this semester I shifted from programming in C to C++, which I really did enjoy.
My Discrete Mathematics 2 class was the most challenging class for me this semester. However, its the class that I most most enjoyed. Even though I struggled during this class I feel I learned the biggest deal in it.
One other class I enjoyed was Debate about ancient Greek Civilizations. I have always enjoyed learning about Greek Mythology and for that reason I took the class. The teacher Janet Spiller, although still being a student, made class one of the most enjoyable ones this semester.

#The KiwiCrushers Team

We met in a discord server and decided to team up for HackFSU. Brandon was in one of my classes and I invited him to take part of the team. We then met Carlos for the first time in the opening ceremony of HackFSU. We then clicked and noticed we where all quite similar and clicked quite well. We then spent our time working towards our project named CalBot (add link) which won us first place for the Hackathon. One of my first and proudest moments so far as a Computer Scientist. Incredibly proud of my team and I and cant wait for the next one.
#Future activities

Looking forward to attent Swamphacks 2020 with the KiwiCrushers team. 
#Goals
